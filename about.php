            <p> The Lamp is a historic building owed by Kylie Gunn. Kylie is a key part of helping Lamp books stay afloat, she took the business on when it went under and moved the business into the Lamp complex which was truly a blessing.
            Lisa is the manager of the bookshop and currently being down on staff, Lisa runs the sshow at Lamp books majority of the time. She has extensive knowledge of christian books and the bible and is always happy to help.
